'benchmark.set.1.rds, benchmark.set.2.rds, benchmark.set.3.rds: The previously published datasets were downloaded from ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD013277 (Benchmark Set 1), PXD007145 (Benchmark Set 2), PXD021661 (Benchmark Set 3). Thermo RAW files were converted to mzML by ThermoRawFileParser v1.4.08. Spectra were searched using the MSFragger search engine v3.89 in FragPipe computational platform v20.0 against the UniProt proteome databases for the corresponding organisms (downloaded on October 22nd, 2023) appended to a list of common contaminants. Identification parameters in MSFragger were specified based on the description of original publications to investigate the generalizability of attribute-weighted aggregation under different searching conditions. MS/MS spectral deisotoping, and parameter optimization were enabled in all searches. Search output was processed by Philosopher workflow10 and Percolator. Proteins were filtered to a 1% protein-level false discovery rate using the default strategy. In the Benchmark Set 2, an additional PTM-Shepherd was applied to analyze the phosphopeptides.
The obtained PSMs were filtered for the shared peptides, contaminants, and a purity lower than 0.5. PSMs with a reporter ion intensity in the reference channels at the bottom 1% were also removed from the Benchmark Set 2 to ensure proteins in the reference samples were quantified precisely, which is critical for the following pooled internal standard (PIS) normalization. Missing values in tandem mass tag experiments were imputed by a number between 0 and the lowest 5% of reporter ion intensities in all non-empty channels. PIS normalization was done for the Benchmark Set 2. Normalization using virtual reference calculated by the average reporter ion intensities across all channels in a PSM was done for the Benchmark Set 1 and Benchmark Set 3 because no PIS was used in these sets. Only the proteins with more than 1 peptide and at least 1 unique were quantified to ensure accuracy. PSM attributes are generated using the AWAggregator::get_attributes.'

'regr.rds and regr.no.CV.rds: To build a machine learning model with generalizability, PSMs mapped to a proportion of identified proteins were extracted from benchmark.set.1.rds, benchmark.set.2.rds and benchmark.set.3.rds, and merged into a single training set. In this process, for each protein, either all or none of PSMs mapped to this protein were selected because each complete set of PSMs from a selected protein provided an example of the variability of PSMs having various levels of quantitative inaccuracy without being potentially influenced by the differences in their mapped proteins alongside various combinations of PSM attribute values. Similar numbers of PSMs were extracted from each BM dataset (n = 19582, equal to 11.2%, PSMs in Benchmark Set 1; 19566, equal to 100%, PSMs in Benchmark Set 2; and 19569, equal to 88.5%, PSMs in Benchmark Set 3) so that all spike-in benchmark datasets can equally contribute to the training of the random forest model in the AWA algorithm. Attributes of Charge, Calibrated Observed Mass, Calibrated Observed M/Z, Delta Mass, Scaled Hyperscore, Number of Missed Cleavages, Scaled Intensity, Purity, Scaled # Variable Modifications, Average CV [%] (for regr.rds only), Distance Metric and the composition of 20 amino acids are used as input to generate two machine learning models with 500 trees.'
