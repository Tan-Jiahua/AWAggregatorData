The `AWAggregatorData` package contains the data associated with the `AWAggregator` R package. It includes two pre-trained random forest models, one incorporating the average coefficient of variation as a feature, and the other one not including it. It also contains the PSMs in Benchmark Set 1 ~ 3 derived from the `psm.tsv` output files generated by FragPipe, which are used to train the random forest models.
