Description: The AWAggregatorData package contains the data associated with the 
    AWAggregator R package. It includes two pre-trained random forest models, 
    one incorporating the average coefficient of variation as a feature, and 
    the other one not including it. It also contains the PSMs in Benchmark Set 
    1~3 derived from the psm.tsv output files generated by FragPipe, which are 
    used to train the random forest models.
